# Telemetry-display
Python matplotlib-based graphical viewer for telemetry streams

## Setup instructions
### Linux
1. Install python3 and python3-pip via apt-get
2. Install matplotlib and pyserial via pip3
3. Try running it... There may be other dependencies depending on your system that werenâ€™t installed automatically.  If it crashes due to missing imports, the error message should include the name of the missing library which can be installed via pip3.  If you run into any of these please tell me (Lucas)

### Mac
Same as instructions for Windows, except you will likely need to install a package manager first instead of apt-get (I have found that brew works well)

### Windows
You can simply download the packaged executables under dist, which should run with no extra dependancies.  Jon is working on figuring out how to install python with the required libraries directly, to side-step this.  

## Building a distribution
If you want to create a packaged dist that others can use without installing python and the needed libraries, you can do this.  It uses pyinstaller to bundle the source code, all needed libraries and the python interpreter into one binary.  

### Building on the target system
1. Make sure that you can run the code directly and that all needed libraries are installed, as above.  
2. Install pyinstaller, clone this git repository: git://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller.git.  You can also install via pip, but this depends on some (recent) bug fixes making it into the dist first.
3. Set the ```PYINSTALLER_PATH``` variable in the ```make_dist``` script to whatever the location of the pyinstaller script is.  This is ```pyinstaller.py``` if you cloned the repo, otherwise whatever the output of ```which pyinstaller``` is on Linux if you installed via pip.
4. Run the ```make_dist``` script with no arguments.  The resulting binaries will go in the 'dist' folder.
On Windows you may run into errors with something called 'pefile' missing.  If so, you can install that library via pip.
If things crash after building more than once, you can delete the generated build folder.  
You should just be able to run on Linux to make a Linux dist, and on Windows to make a Windows dist once bash for Windows is released.
Note that Linux dist builds are uncompressed and very large, I am working on a fix to this...

### Cross-compiling a Windows distribution using wine on Linux
Unless your name is Lucas (or maybe Jude?), you should ignore this.  I am putting it here for reference anyway.  
1. Install wine (can be done via apt-get) and pyinstaller (see above)
2. Get a msi python installer image for a recent release of python 3.4+.  As of writing, the latest is 3.4.4:
```> wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.4/python-3.4.4.msi```
3. Install python onto the wine virtual windows environment:
```> wine msiexec /i python-3.4.4.msi```
This will open a grapical Windows installer window, you should be able to click through this keeping the default options.  This will install both python 3 and pip.
4. Copy the executables python.exe and pip*.exe from ```~/.wine/drive_c/Python34``` to ```~/.wine/drive_c/windows```.  This makes it so you don't have to give the absolute paths to the exes to wine every time you want to run.
5. Verify that python is working correctly by running
```> wine python```
This should print the python version and start the python REPL.
6. Install pefile (needed for pyinstaller on Windows), matplotlib and pyserial, this can be done via pip with
```> wine python -m pip install -U pefile matplotlib pyserial```
7. Set up the ```make_dist``` script with pyinstaller as above
8. You are finally ready to build!  Run
```> ./make_dist --wine-build```.  This should build the executatbles and put them in the dist folder.
9. To test the build, you can run the exes with wine:
```> wine dist/flight_test_gue.exe```
10. Remember to commit and push the new builds to be public on github, if you are ready.  

## TODO items
### Major
* Get CSV parsing working
* Command line inteface
* Show invalid packets in serial window as a different color instead of stdout
* Multiple plots on the same graph?  

### Minor
* Nice setup configuration modes (What did I mean by this?)

## Known issues
* No automatic restart after port change, need to start/stop/reset (check if resolved?)
