# Telemetry-display
Python matplotlib-based graphical viewer for telemetry streams

## TODO items
### Major
* Get CSV parsing working
* Command line inteface
* Show invalid packets in serial window as a different color instead of stdout
* Multiple plots on the same graph?  

### Minor
* Nice setup configuration modes (What did I mean by this?)

## Known issues
* No automatic restart after port change, need to start/stop/reset (check if resolved?)
