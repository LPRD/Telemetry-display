# Telemetry-display
Python matplotlib-based graphical viewer for telemetry streams

## TODO items
### Minor
* Real-time logging
* Nice setup configuration modes
* Export graphs as images

### Major
* Extensible gui panel?  
* Multiple plots on the same graph?  

## Known issues
* Partial crash when USB disconnected
* No automatic restart after port change, need to start/stop/reset
